A simple contacts app in C and Rust.

This is a learning project. The intention is to implement a simple, command line contacts
application in both C and Rust as a way of comparing the two languages. It will be challenging
for me because, at the moment, I know neither of the languages in question! In fact, the point
of this exercise is to motivate my learning.
